# SCXML_SIRIUS
SCXML SIRIUS diagram editor with support for Event-B extensions
(Based on a test sample provided by OBEO in the sirius repositories)

A sirius-based diagram editor for SCXML models that also supports model extensions needed for translating SCXML models into iUML-B/Event-B. For example, annotations can be added to the SCXML state hierarchy to indicate the refinement level at which that state was introduced.
